Reasons for choosing this design pattern 

Interface was designed to provide a blueprint for any space within the warehouse, whether it's a single space or a space that's part of a larger crate.It encapsulates common methods that are essential for managing products within spaces, thus ensuring uniformity in the behavior of spaces in the warehouse

Store Operation:
Before storing a product, the code checks if the dimensions fit within the warehouse and if spaces required for the product are unoccupied.
This helps prevent overwriting of existing products and ensures that products do not exceed the warehouse boundaries.
Locate and Remove Operations:
The locate method checks every space in the warehouse for a specific product code, giving the user a comprehensive view of where products are located.
The remove method was designed to locate a product by any of its positions, and once found, all spaces occupied by that product are cleared.
View Method:
The view method provides a visual representation of the warehouse grid with product codes for easy visualization.
Areas of Improvement:
Error Handling:
The code currently lacks detailed error messages. Improved error handling can guide the user better when they make mistakes, such as trying to store a product outside the warehouse boundaries or in an already occupied space.


Features like searching for available space, getting a summary of product counts, or optimizing storage  can be added in the future.
